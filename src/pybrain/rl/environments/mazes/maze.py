    It has a finite number of states, a subset of which are potential starting states (default: all except goal states).
    A maze can have absorbing states, which, when reached end the episode (default: there is one, the goal).

    There is a single agent walking around in the maze (Theseus).
    The movement can succeed or not, or be stochastically determined.
    Running against a wall does not get you anywhere.

    Every state can have an an associated reward (default: 1 on goal, 0 elsewhere).
    The observations can be noisy.
