The file direction.wgt is a weight matrix of a feed forward network with 4 hidden units learned as controller on the standard walk direction task.
Load direction.wgt in flexCube_pgpe.py, set hiddenUnits to 4 and set epsilon to a very small number.
The video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEM7YDNonSE shows the corresponding behavior.
