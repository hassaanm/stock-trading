PyBrain was developed originally as a joint project between 
PhD students at IDSIA and at the CogBotLab at the TU Munich.

Part of the development was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation 
grants 200021-111968/1 and 200021-113364/1, as well as through the 
Excellence Cluster Cognition for Technical Systems (CoTeSys)
